Everyone wants to build a career in software development. Most of you are ready to work hard as well. However you are unsure whether this hard work will lead to the desired results.
 
I have personally faced this during my undergraduate at IIT Delhi and have seen thousands of students feeling stressed because of this.
 
As a Coding Ninjas founder and as a teacher I have seen lakhs of students go through this journey, the mistakes that they have made and how they have ended up succeeding as well.
 
I have summarized these learnings into a small series of articles. Want to know the secret? 
 
Guide me in the right direction  :)
 
Read this article, it shouldn't take you more than 9 minutes. It is a great way to start off the New Year!
